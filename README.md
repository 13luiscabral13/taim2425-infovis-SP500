# Who owns what? (Example)
- Global Value: show all shareholders and the companies each of them hold
- Filtered by shareholder: show, for a specific shareholder, the companies they hold and how much they hold in each company
- Filtered by sector: show the same thing as above, but only for companies in a specific sector
- Filtered by industry: show the same thing as above, but only for companies in a specific industry
- Filtered by geographic region: show the same thing as above, but only for companies in a specific geographic region

# How much wealth is concentrated? (Example)
- Global view: Compare shareholders in terms of raw wealth compared to the total wealth (sum of the "value" column- total health; sum of the "value" column for each shareholder) (for example, see how much the top10 hold in comparison to the others)
- Filter by sector: Now do the same comparison but only for a specific sector. Here, we need to associate each shareholder with its sectors (sum of the "value" column but only, for example, where the sector is technology- total wealth in the technology sector; sum of the "value" column for each shareholder only in the selected sector)
- Filter by industry: Now do the same comparison but only for a specific industry. Here, we need to associate each shareholder with its industries (sum of the "value" column but only, for example, where the industry is semiconductors- total wealth in the semiconductors industry; sum of the "value" column for each shareholder only in the selected industry)
- Filter by geographic region: Now do the same comparison but only for a specific region. Here, we need to associate each shareholder with the company region (sum of the "value" column but only, for example, where the region is CA- total wealth in the CA; sum of the "value" column for each shareholder only in the selected region)
